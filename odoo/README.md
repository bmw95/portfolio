# Odoo Directory README

This directory includes some of the major projects I worked on while
contributing to the Odoo Community Association (OCA), under contract with a client.

## What is Odoo?

Odoo is an open source (closed-source enterprise version available as well) ERP platform that aims to integrate everything from logistics and warehousing, e-commerce, crm, accounting, project management, medical, shipping, and far more into a single platform. Similar platforms include Microsoft Dynamics, Deltek, SAP ERP, Netsuite, and others.

The platform core is available at:

* [https://github.com/odoo/odoo](https://github.com/odoo/odoo)

To extend the core, developers will create modules that add additional functionality and features.

While I contributed a significant amount of time upgrading and improving many modules, the ones included here have been either entirely built by me or the majority of the code is mine (Github user bmw95).

## Original Module Locations

The below table includes the locations from which the code was copied from. Branch specific.
These locations are subject to change without notice.

In some cases a pull request might be used as a link, if the code is not yet present in the related repository.

## Commit History

The commit history for the modules has been preserved when migrating the commits over from OCA (apart from language translations, those were removed). No more commits will be added to these modules regardless of contributor changes in OCA, unless the changes are mine.

## Code and Licenses

**Any individual or entity that uses or edits the code here, for their own use, does so at their own risk.** The code is provided as-is and is intended to be view-only for educational/showcasing purposes. Those interested in using the code must go to OCA on Github. Use of the code is subject to OCA's rules and terms of use.

Their FAQ can be found here:

Changes in licensing for an original module on OCA Github,
found using the respective URL location link in the table above, will override its license in this directory.
