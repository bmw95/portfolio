# Portfolio README

Hi there,

This repository contains any significant development projects I've worked on in the past. Each directory contains a README with more details about the work in that directory. Any licensing notes are also in each directory's README.

Below is a list of each directory and a quick note on what kind of work is in it.

## Odoo
This directory contains addon modules I built for Odoo, an open source ERP platform. Similar platforms include Microsoft Dynamics, SAP ERP, Deltek, Netsuite, and many others.
