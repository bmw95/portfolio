# Portfolio README

Hi there,

This repository contains any significant development projects I've worked on in the past. Each directory contains a README with more details about the work in that directory. Any licensing notes are also in each directory's README.

If you're looking for work related to design and business strategy feel free to visit my website at [brettwood.io](brettwood.io) where I post my projects and case studies.

Below is a list of each directory and a quick note on what kind of work is in it.

## Odoo
This directory contains addon modules I built for Odoo, an open source ERP platform. Similar platforms include Microsoft Dynamics, SAP ERP, Deltek, Netsuite, and many others.
